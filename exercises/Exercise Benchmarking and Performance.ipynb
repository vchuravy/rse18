    "## Performance tips -- type stability\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to optimize code in Julia is to ensure **type stability**. If the type(s) of some variables in a function are subject to change or ambiguity, the compiler cannot reason as well about those variables, and performance will take a hit. Conversely, we allow the compiler to optimize and generate more efficient machine code when we declare variables so that their types will be fixed throughout the function body.\n",

    "```\n",

    "I see that `bar` is almost three times as fast as `baz`! The reason is that `bar` is type stable while `baz` is not: the compiler can tell that `bar` will always return a `Float`, whereas `baz` could return a `Float`, an `Int`, or a `Rational`. When the compiler can tell what the types of outputs from a function, or variables declared *within a function* are without running the code, it can do much better.\n",
